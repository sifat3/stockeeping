This is a Django project for stock keeping.
I built it for a client who wants to keep track of his fuel pump business.
This project can track buying, selling. You can add new products and edit existing products only if you're the owner(SuperUser).
For other tasks you don't need to login.
It shows Track record of profit for daily, weekly and Monthly, also compare past 7 days, 7 weeks and 7 months in graph.
Although most of the content is in Bengali because of the client's requirement.
This app can generate custom pdf files(invoice) for each sales.
